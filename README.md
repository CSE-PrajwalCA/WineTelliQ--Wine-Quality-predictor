# WineTelliQ--Wine-Quality-predictor
Developed a full-stack Wine Quality Prediction web application using Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. Trained a machine learning model on the Wine Quality Dataset (WineQT.csv) to accurately predict wine quality, integrating the model into the web application for real-time predictions.
